        <p>Uni the unicorn is told there’s no such thing as little girls! But no matter what the grown-up unicorns say,
            Uni believes that little girls are REAL. Somewhere there must be a smart, strong, wonderful, magical little
            girl waiting to be best friends. In fact, far away (but not too far away), a real little girl believes there
            is a unicorn waiting for her, too. This magical story of friendship reminds believers and nonbelievers alike
            that sometimes wishes really can come true.
